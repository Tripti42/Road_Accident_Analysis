# ðŸš— Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents a detailed analysis of road accident data to uncover key trends, patterns, and actionable insights related to accident severity, location, timing, weather conditions, and road types. The goal is to support data-driven decisions for improving road safety and traffic management.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes:
- Accident counts by month, time of day, day of the week
- Casualties by severity and location (urban/rural, junctions, road types)
- Weather conditions during accidents
- Year-wise comparison (2021 vs. 2022)

> **Note:** The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed for effective visualization and analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** â€“ for creating interactive dashboards and visuals

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **November** had the highest number of accidents â€“ possible seasonal impact.
- **Afternoon hours** saw the most casualties; **nighttime** had the fewest.
- **Friday** had the highest number of accidents; **Sunday** the lowest.
- **Urban areas and junctions** reported significantly more accidents.
- Most accidents were **slight in severity**; **fatalities** were least common.
- Majority occurred in **fine weather**; rain contributed to the second-highest count.
- **Single carriageway roads** had the highest casualties.

## âœ… Conclusion

- Accident patterns suggest critical windows for intervention: **afternoons**, **Fridays**, and **urban junctions**.
- Weather alone doesnâ€™t ensure road safetyâ€”driver behavior remains key.
- Recommendations include improved **traffic control at intersections**, **public awareness**, and **infrastructure upgrades** on vulnerable road types.
